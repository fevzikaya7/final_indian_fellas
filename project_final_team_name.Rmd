### Project Proposal
As it is known, Australian forest fires occur at certain times each year. There is even talk of the 'Bushfire Season' in Australia. We will try to explain this disaster, in which millions of living species were affected, with climatic changes. The world is in a state of equilibrium, but this balance is breaking down day by day. This balance was also valid between South Africa and Australia, connected by the Indian Ocean. While there are fires on one side, there can be flood disasters on the other.

### Project Goal        
In this project:        
We will examine the relationship between Indian Ocean temperature change and Australian bushfires. We will examine the Indian Ocean Dipole (temperature difference between the South African coast and the Australian coast). The 2019 Australian fire destroyed over 15 million hectares.           

### Data Documents        
We couldn't upload it to Github because the data is too large.        
Data were obtained from the following sites.        
You can view the Indian Ocean data **[here.](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/search/index)**       
Australia data was created by collecting from the internet.             
---       
To access all data collectively **[Drive Link.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i5FcInJoKhZRK6S0aK8qHxZKMgZ_5TVM/view?usp=sharing)**       
            
            
**Variables we intend to use:**    
    
Surface temperature of the water, longitude, latitude, date, burned area

# Result and Discussion       

There is a difference between the temperature values found by climate scientists and what we find, and this is natural. Because, as it is written in the source image below, they examined the temperature difference between the two points they chose. On the other hand, we examined a large region and actually got the result as we expected. As can be seen, the temperature, which normally hovers between (-5, +5) values, reached +10 degrees towards the end of 2019. This coincides with the fire season. As a result, we were able to establish the relationship we wanted.
